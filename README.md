### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/latest_ai_development/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/latest_ai_development/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/latest_ai_development/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/latest_ai_development/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Understanding Your Crew

The agentic Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
